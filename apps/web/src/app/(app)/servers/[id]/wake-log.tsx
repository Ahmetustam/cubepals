/**
 * What a server is doing while it wakes, under the button that woke it: the step it is on, how
 * long is left, and the newest few things it said, in Minecraft's words, entering one at a time.
 * The same on the server page and in settings. A resume that is back in a second or two never
 * opens it; a cold boot fills it for most of a minute; silence says, in words, what it is doing.
 *
 * `useWake` keeps what it heard where the page keeps it, so a wake that fails can still show how
 * far it got after the button that started it is gone. `WakeLog` only draws it. Not for a first
 * build, which has its own panel (`boot-line.tsx`), nor for the console, which shows everything.
